"""T-RR.9 (B39) — Atomic promote-and-demote on worker READY transition.

When a worker finishes a re-ingest of an existing (source_id, source_app),
the new doc's READY transition must — in the same DB transaction —
atomically demote any prior READY siblings to DELETING. Combined with B36
(_SourceHydrator drops chunks whose document_id is not READY), retrieval
transitions to the new revision the moment the worker's tx commits — no
race window where both old and new are READY and both retrievable.
