"""Shared helpers for chaos drill cases C1..C6 (spec §3.6.1, B49).

Per-case files under `tests/e2e/test_chaos/` use these to:
  - reset WireMock stubs between cases so injection state from C3/C4/C5/C6
    cannot leak into the next case
  - scrape `chaos_drill_outcome_total{case,outcome}` and record the outcome
    of the case (the gate of B49 requires every case to record its
    `pass`/`fail` so nightly CI can plot drill history)

Fixture-reuse policy (B49):
  - C3 / C4 / C5 / C6 are WireMock-only injections — they reuse the
    session-scoped `running_stack` to avoid the per-case ~30s testcontainer
    boot tax.
  - C1 / C2 deliberately kill the worker process — they use `spawn_module`
    (function-scope) instead because session-scoped subprocesses would be
    left in a dead state for the rest of the session.
