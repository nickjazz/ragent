# CLAUDE.md - Project Guidelines & TDD Workflow

* Read `docs/00_rule.md` and follow development standards and mandatory workflow for this project.
* Read `docs/00_domain_map.md` **before every task** — it defines the module domain boundaries, allowed dependency directions, and AI harness rules (R1–R7) that govern all code changes.
* Strict adherence to **TDD (Test-Driven Development)** and **Minimalism** and **Integrity** are required.

## THE TDD WORKFLOW

Whenever team start to work or user says "go" or "continue", follow these steps precisely:

1.  **Read `plan.md`**: Find the next unmarked test item `[ ]`.
2.  **Red Phase**: Implement the failing test first. Verify it fails.
3.  **Green Phase**: Write the **minimum** code necessary to make the test pass.
4.  **Refactor Phase**: Clean up the code while ensuring tests remain green.
5.  **Verification**: Run test, lint, format.
6.  **Progress**: Mark the test as complete `[x]` in `plan.md`.
7.  **Simplify**: Run `/simplify` — AI code quality pass; stage any resulting fixes and re-verify tests pass.
8.  **Review**: Run `/review` — team code review covering **all** of the following; address every finding before proceeding:
    - **Plan compliance**: every objective in `docs/00_plan.md` for this cycle is fully implemented — no partial or skipped items.
    - **Spec alignment**: behaviour matches `docs/00_spec.md` contracts (HTTP shapes, error codes, streaming framing, DB schema, etc.).
    - **Test coverage**: every new behaviour path has a corresponding test; no dead or unreachable code.
    - **Code quality**: no duplication, no hidden coupling, no premature abstraction, no commented-out code.

    The stamp is emitted as the **last action of each skill body** (the
    `/simplify` and `/review` skill prompts call the hardened script with
    `RAGENT_SKILL_INVOCATION_TOKEN` set). The agent NEVER stamps manually
    — there is no shell-callable bypass.
9.  **Commit**: Git commit with `[BEHAVIORAL]` or `[STRUCTURAL]` prefix.
    _(The pre-commit gate verifies the marker JSON, the `diff_sha` binding,
    the freshness window, AND the audit log shows BOTH /simplify and /review
    ran for the current diff. It then consumes the marker.)_
10. **Documentation**: Follow "RESOURCES" Section to update each document accordingly.
11. **PR**: After every `git push`, immediately create a pull request using
    `mcp__github__create_pull_request` with a body containing all three required
    sections from `docs/00_rule.md §PR description rule`:
    **總結決策** / **業務意涵** / **異動檔案簡述** (Markdown table).
    Never skip this step; a PR body copied from the commit message alone is non-compliant.
    If the push was made **in response to PR review comments**, reply to every
    addressed comment via `mcp__github__add_reply_to_pull_request_comment` before
    ending the turn — one reply per comment, stating what was changed.
12. **Next**: Start new round and repeat the workflow until all plans matches successful criteria.

## TIDY FIRST APPROACH

Separate all changes into two distinct types:

### 1. STRUCTURAL CHANGES

Rearranging code without changing behavior:

- Renaming variables, methods, or classes for clarity
- Extracting methods or functions
- Moving code to more appropriate locations
- Reorganizing imports or dependencies
- Reformatting code

### 2. BEHAVIORAL CHANGES

Adding or modifying actual functionality:

- Implementing new features
- Fixing bugs that change program behavior
- Modifying algorithms or logic
- Adding new dependencies that change behavior

### Critical Rules:

- **Never mix structural and behavioral changes in the same commit**
- **Always make structural changes first** when both are needed
- Validate structural changes do not alter behavior by running tests before and after
- If a structural change breaks tests, revert and investigate

## CORE DEVELOPMENT PHILOSOPHY

### 1. Think Before Coding
*   **Understand** essence of the problem. Solutions must be able to achieve the goal and solve the problem.
*   **Surface Trade-offs**: If multiple solutions exist, present them. Never pick silently.
*   **No Assumptions**: Explicitly state assumptions. If a requirement is vague, **stop and ask**.
*   **Push Back**: If a simpler approach exists, suggest it. Avoid over-engineering.
*   **Best Practice**: Always refer to industry best practices and don't reinvent the wheel.

### 2. Simplicity First (YAGNI)
*   **Minimum Viable Code**: No speculative features or "future-proofing."
*   **No Abstractions**: Avoid abstractions for single-use logic.
*   **Refinement**: If 50 lines can do what 200 lines do, rewrite it.

### 3. Surgical Changes
*   **Scope Control**: Touch only what is necessary. Do not "improve" adjacent code or formatting.
*   **Style Matching**: Match existing patterns and idioms, even if you prefer others.
*   **Orphan Cleanup**: Only remove imports/variables made unused by **your** changes.

---

## CODE QUALITY STANDARDS
IMPORTANT: Quality is non-negotiable. Every line of code must be traceable to a test and a specific requirement.

*   **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Eliminate duplication ruthlessly.
*   **SRP (Single Responsibility)**: Keep methods small and focused.
*   **Explicit Dependencies**: No hidden coupling or global state side effects.
*   **Documentation**: Explain *why* something is done, not *what* (the code should be self-explanatory).

---

## TESTING STRATEGY

### The Test Pyramid
*   **Unit Tests (80%)**: Focus on individual functions. Must be fast (<1s) with no external I/O (use mocks for S3, JWT, etc.).
*   **Integration Tests (15%)**: Test component interactions (Router + Auth + Storage). Test Coverage > 90%.
*   **E2E Tests (5%)**: Full-stack workflows with real MinIO. Mark with `#[ignore]` for manual runs.

### Organization
```text
tests/
├── unit/           # Fast unit logic
├── integration/    # Component orchestration
└── e2e/            # Full proxy/system flows
```

## RESOURCES
* README.md: Quick start and overview.
* `docs/00_rule.md`: Project Rule.
* `docs/00_spec.md`: Full technical specification.
* `docs/00_plan.md`: The master TDD implementation checklist.
* `docs/00_agent_team.md`: RAGENT agent team and workflow.
* `docs/00_journal.md`: Team reflection that prevents the same mistake from happening again. Create blameless, actionable, and documented guidelines by **DOMAIN**.

## Common Commands

```bash
make doctor                    # pre-flight: env / datastores / AI endpoints / alembic head
make doctor PROBE_LIVE=1       # post-launch: also probes /livez and /readyz

uv run pytest tests/unit/test_X.py::test_Y -x        # single test
uv run --env-file .env alembic upgrade head          # migrations
uv run --env-file .env python -m ragent.api          # API (port 8000)
uv run --env-file .env python -m ragent.worker       # background worker
```

## Pre-commit Approval Marker

The pre-commit hook (`.claude/hooks/pre_commit_gate.sh`) verifies four things
against `.claude/.pre_commit_approved` and `.claude/.stamp_audit.log`:

1. The marker file is valid JSON `{"diff_sha": <sha256 git diff --cached>,
   "ts": <epoch>, "by": "simplify"|"review"}` — manual `date >` stamping
   produces plain text and is rejected.
2. `ts` is within the 45-minute freshness window.
3. `diff_sha` matches the staged diff's sha256 *now* (re-staging after
   stamping invalidates the marker).
4. The append-only audit log contains BOTH a `"by":"simplify"` entry AND a
   `"by":"review"` entry for the current `diff_sha`, each with `ts` inside
   the same 45-minute freshness window (a single skill running twice no
   longer satisfies the gate, and stale entries from a long-ago review of
   the same diff are also rejected).

The marker is emitted ONLY by `.claude/hooks/stamp_pre_commit_approved.sh
<simplify|review>`, which itself refuses to run unless
`RAGENT_SKILL_INVOCATION_TOKEN` is set. That env var is set inside the
`/simplify` and `/review` skill bodies — no shell-callable bypass exists.
The hook consumes the marker on commit; the next commit needs a fresh
`/simplify` + `/review` cycle.

## Architecture (orientation only — read `docs/00_spec.md` for contracts)

- **Composition root**: `src/ragent/bootstrap/composition.py::build_container()`
  is the single DI seam. Every external dep (MariaDB, ES, Redis, MinIO,
  AI clients) is constructed here and injected into routers/services/workers.
  Don't read env vars elsewhere.
- **Three processes**: `ragent.api` (FastAPI), `ragent.worker` (TaskIQ),
  `ragent.reconciler` (K8s CronJob — safety net, not load-bearing for the
  local two-command path).
- **Ingest contract**: discriminated union (`inline | file`) → MinIO stage
  → DB row UPLOADED → kiq → worker pipeline (load → split → chunk → embed
  → ES write) → READY. Chunks live in ES `chunks_v1` only; the v1 `chunks`
  DB table was dropped in `003_drop_chunks.sql`.
- **Chat contract**: `_QueryEmbedder → ES{vector+BM25} → joiner → reranker
  (optional) → _SourceHydrator → _ExcerptTruncator`. Hydrator filters by
  `documents.status='READY'`.
- **Idempotency**: ES writes use `DuplicatePolicy.OVERWRITE`; worker
  pipeline is retry-safe. Supersede uses DB-elected `MAX(created_at)`
  survivor — caller-supplied `survivor_id` must match the elected row.
