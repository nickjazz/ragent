"""Built-in preset skills (T-SK presets).

Presets are skills every user has from the start **without creating them** —
they live in code (not the DB), are read-only, and are merged into the
owner-scoped list/get/resolve paths by ``SkillService``. Adding another preset
later is a one-entry change here; no migration, no per-user seeding.

Design notes:
- A preset's ``skill_id`` is a stable, human-readable slug (e.g. ``skill-manager``)
  — distinct from the 26-char Crockford ids minted for user rows — so it can be
  referenced verbatim in ``forwardedProps.skillId`` and ``GET /skills/v1/{id}``.
- Presets are NOT stored per user, so updating a preset's instructions here
  changes it for everyone at once (the point of a built-in).
- ``name`` collisions are forbidden for user skills (``SkillService.create`` /
  ``update`` reject any name matching a preset, case-insensitively via
  ``PRESET_NAMES_CASEFOLD``) so the merged list is unambiguous.

    "user's own skills using these tools:\n"
    "- create_skill(name, description, instructions, enabled?) — save a new skill.\n"
    "- list_skills() — list the user's skills; each entry has a `skill_id` and a "
    "`readonly` flag.\n"
    "- get_skill(skill_id) — view one skill's full details.\n"
    "- update_skill(skill_id, name, description, instructions, enabled) — full "
    "replace of an existing skill (set `enabled` to show/hide it).\n"
    "- delete_skill(skill_id) — permanently remove a skill.\n\n"
    "A skill has three editable fields: name (short, unique label, <=128 chars), "

    "prompt in the second person — 'You are…', 'Always…', 'Never…' — <=16384 chars).\n\n"
    "How to work:\n"
    "- Default to DRAFTING, not interrogating: from whatever the user gives you — "
    "even a single sentence — propose complete field values, infer sensible "
    "defaults, and state any assumption in one short line so the user can correct "
    "it. Ask a clarifying question only when a field genuinely cannot be drafted.\n"
    "- Before any update/get/delete, resolve which skill the user means to a "
    "concrete `skill_id` via list_skills — never guess an id.\n"
    "- Built-in skills are READ-ONLY: list_skills marks them `readonly=true`. You "
    "can view them but cannot edit or delete them; if asked, explain they are "
    "built in and offer to create an editable copy instead.\n"
    "- CONFIRM before deleting or overwriting: read back exactly what will change "
    "and get a yes first.\n"
    "- After any change, briefly confirm the result and that the user can select "
    "the skill for a future chat turn.\n"
    "- Only ever act on the user's own skills, and don't invent requirements the "
    "user did not ask for."
