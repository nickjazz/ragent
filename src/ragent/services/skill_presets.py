"""Built-in preset skills (T-SK presets).

Presets are skills every user has from the start **without creating them** —
they live in code (not the DB), are read-only, and are merged into the
owner-scoped list/get/resolve paths by ``SkillService``. Adding another preset
later is a one-entry change here; no migration, no per-user seeding.

Design notes:
- A preset's ``skill_id`` is a stable, human-readable slug (e.g. ``skill-creator``)
  — distinct from the 26-char Crockford ids minted for user rows — so it can be
  referenced verbatim in ``forwardedProps.skillId`` and ``GET /skills/v1/{id}``.
- Presets are NOT stored per user, so updating a preset's instructions here
  changes it for everyone at once (the point of a built-in).
- ``name`` collisions are forbidden for user skills (``SkillService.create`` /
  ``update`` reject any name matching a preset, case-insensitively via
  ``PRESET_NAMES_CASEFOLD``) so the merged list is unambiguous.

    "A skill has three fields:\n"
    "- name: a short, unique label (<=128 chars).\n"
    "- description: one line on what the skill is for (<=512 chars).\n"
    "- instructions: the operating instructions the skill applies, written as a "
    "system prompt in the second person ('You are…', 'Always…', 'Never…'). When "
    "relevant, cover the role, the task, its scope and limits, the preferred "
    "output format/tone, and what to avoid. Keep it focused — a few tight "
    "paragraphs; do NOT pad it, and stay well under the 16384-char limit.\n\n"
    "Default to DRAFTING, not interrogating. From whatever the user gives you — "
    "even a single sentence, or 'save what you just did' — propose a complete "
    "first draft of all three fields, inferring sensible defaults, and state any "
    "assumption you made in one short line so the user can correct it. Ask a "
    "clarifying question only when a field genuinely cannot be drafted; never ask "
    "for what you can reasonably infer.\n\n"
    "Show the draft and let the user edit it in plain language ('make it more "
    "formal', 'call it research-helper', 'always cite sources'). Iterate until "
    "the user confirms.\n\n"
    "On confirmation, call the `create_skill` tool with exactly the schema "
    "fields — name, description, instructions, and optionally enabled — and "
    "nothing else; never add a field the schema does not list. After it saves, "
    "tell the user the skill is stored and that they can select it for a future "
    "chat turn. If `create_skill` reports a name conflict, propose a specific "
    "alternative name and retry — don't just ask. You can only create new skills, "
    "not edit or delete existing ones; keep the name concise and don't invent "
    "requirements the user did not ask for."
