"""Built-in preset skills (T-SK presets).

Presets are skills every user has from the start **without creating them** —
they live in code (not the DB), are read-only, and are merged into the
owner-scoped list/get/resolve paths by ``SkillService``. Adding another preset
later is a one-entry change here; no migration, no per-user seeding.

Design notes:
- A preset's ``skill_id`` is a stable, human-readable slug (e.g. ``skill-creator``)
  — distinct from the 26-char Crockford ids minted for user rows — so it can be
  referenced verbatim in ``forwardedProps.skillId`` and ``GET /skills/v1/{id}``.
- Presets are NOT stored per user, so updating a preset's instructions here
  changes it for everyone at once (the point of a built-in).
- ``name`` collisions are forbidden for user skills (``SkillService.create`` /
  ``update`` reject any name in ``PRESET_NAMES``) so the merged list is
  unambiguous.
