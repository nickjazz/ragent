"""Generic authenticated reverse proxy for the ragent-brain management surface.

Fronts brain's entire ``/upstream/*`` API through ragent under
``/brainagent/v1/{path}`` → brain ``{brain_url}/upstream/{path}``, so the whole
brain management surface (session / memory / projects / sources / artifacts /
skills / preferences / schedules) is reachable via ragent and any new brain
``/upstream/*`` route is covered automatically.

Security-critical: the caller's ``user`` is forced to the JWT-resolved identity
in BOTH the query string and (when the body is a JSON object) the body,
overriding any client-supplied value — a client can never read or mutate another
user's data by forging ``user``. ``X-Brain-Key`` is attached server-to-server.

Responses are relayed verbatim: brain's ``422 {"error", "params"}`` i18n
envelope and binary artifact downloads (bytes + ``Content-Type`` /
``Content-Disposition``) both pass through unchanged. Only transport failures are
mapped — timeout → 504, unreachable → 502.

The run surface (``POST /brainagent/v1``, ``/reconnect``, ``/runs/{id}/cancel``)
is handled by `brainagent.py`; its router is mounted FIRST so those explicit
routes win over this catch-all.
