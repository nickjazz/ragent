"""T-CAv3N — NATS publisher for live session-list status (running / new-reply).

Server-authoritative delta channel: ragent publishes a run's start/finish (and a
session-open dot-clear) to a per-user subject; the frontend subscribes over its
own already-open NATS connection and merges the delta onto its ``sessionList``
snapshot. Best-effort — a publish failure only costs one live nudge, because the
durable truth is the Redis run-pointer + unread flag, which the client re-reads
from ``sessionList`` on its next fetch (NATS core pub/sub is lossy, so the client
must re-sync the snapshot on (re)connect anyway).

Why a thread-safe fire-and-forget ``publish``: a run's start/finish events are
emitted from the decoupled producer **thread** (`_run_producer`), not the event
loop, so the publish is scheduled onto the app loop via ``run_coroutine_threadsafe``
and never awaited. The connection is opened in the FastAPI lifespan (async),
while its config is read once in the composition root (the only env seam).
