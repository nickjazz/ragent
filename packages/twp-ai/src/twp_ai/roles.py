"""Shared upstream-role classification for the ChatAgent (ADK) protocol.

A single source of truth for mapping an upstream ChatAgent message
(`role` + `messageMeta.langgraph_node`) to a twp-ai role. Used by both the
streaming `ADKAgent` (to decide a reasoning vs a text block) and the session
history mapper (to label persisted messages). Keeping the rule here prevents
the two surfaces from drifting — they must classify a message identically.
