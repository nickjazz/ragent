"""LLMCaller Protocol and ToolDef — the contract every backend must satisfy.

Any object that implements stream_events() can be used as an LLMCaller.
The adapter never knows which provider is underneath.

Adding a new backend:
  1. Create a class with stream_events() matching the signature below.
  2. Pass it to create_router() or create_app().
  No changes to the adapter, events, or schemas are needed.
