# Hardening (added 2026-05-09 after Process row "Mandatory-step honesty
# (recurrence)" — agent bypassed /simplify+/review for 7 commits by calling
# this script directly without invoking the Skill tool):
#   - Refuses to stamp without RAGENT_SKILL_INVOCATION_TOKEN env var (set
#     ONLY from inside a /simplify or /review skill body).
#   - Validates skill name argument (simplify|review only).
#   - Audit log is append-only — gate verifies BOTH skills' entries exist
#     for the current diff_sha (a forged single stamp now fails the gate).

# Usage (from inside a Skill body only):

stamp script: RAGENT_SKILL_INVOCATION_TOKEN env var required.

  This token is set ONLY from inside a /simplify or /review skill
  invocation. Calling this script with the env var unset means the
  caller is bypassing the quality gates — a process violation per
