# Simplify: Code Review and Cleanup

Review all changed files for reuse, quality, and efficiency. Fix any issues found.

## Mode selection

This skill accepts an optional `--mode fast|full` argument (default: `full`).

| Mode | When to use | What runs |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| `--mode fast` | Pre-commit fast gate on low-risk or high-risk staged diffs | Single inline pass — reuse, quality, efficiency in one response |
| `--mode full` | Pre-push full gate on high-risk commits; default when no mode given | Three parallel sub-agents (Reuse · Quality · Efficiency) |

**Stamp used:** `simplify:fast` or `simplify:full` (see Phase 4).

---

## Phase 1: Identify Changes

If `--mode full` (or no mode): run `git diff` (or `git diff HEAD` if staged changes exist).  
If `--mode fast` and there are staged changes: run `git diff --cached`.  
If no git changes in either case, review the most recently modified files mentioned by the user or edited in this conversation.

## Phase 2: Review

### fast mode — single-pass inline review

In a single response, scan the diff for:

1. **Reuse**: any new function that duplicates an existing utility; inline logic that could use an existing helper.
2. **Quality**: copy-paste blocks, nested conditionals 3+ levels deep, stringly-typed code, unnecessary comments explaining WHAT (not WHY).
3. **Efficiency**: N+1 patterns, sequential work that could be parallel, unbounded data structures.

List findings concisely (one line each). Fix any that are clear-cut. Skip false positives — note and move on.

### full mode — three parallel sub-agents

> **MANDATORY — no exceptions:** ALWAYS launch all three sub-agents even if the diff appears small, focused, or surgical. The phrase *"diff is small/inline review sufficient"* is a process violation — see journal Process 2026-05-17 "Inline /simplify rationalization". The fan-out **is** the review; skipping it means skipping the review.

Use the Agent tool to launch all three agents concurrently in a single message. Pass each agent the full diff so it has complete context.

#### Agent 1: Code Reuse Review

For each change:

1. **Search for existing utilities and helpers** that could replace newly written code. Look for similar patterns elsewhere in the codebase — common locations are utility directories, shared modules, and files adjacent to the changed ones.
2. **Flag any new function that duplicates existing functionality.** Suggest the existing function to use instead.
3. **Flag any inline logic that could use an existing utility** — hand-rolled string manipulation, manual path handling, custom environment checks, ad-hoc type guards, and similar patterns are common candidates.

#### Agent 2: Code Quality Review

Review the same changes for hacky patterns:

1. **Redundant state**: state that duplicates existing state, cached values that could be derived, observers/effects that could be direct calls
2. **Parameter sprawl**: adding new parameters to a function instead of generalizing or restructuring existing ones
3. **Copy-paste with slight variation**: near-duplicate code blocks that should be unified with a shared abstraction
4. **Leaky abstractions**: exposing internal details that should be encapsulated, or breaking existing abstraction boundaries
5. **Stringly-typed code**: using raw strings where constants, enums (string unions), or branded types already exist in the codebase
6. **Nested conditionals**: ternary chains (`a ? x : b ? y : ...`), nested if/else, or nested switch 3+ levels deep — flatten with early returns, guard clauses, a lookup table, or an if/else-if cascade
7. **Unnecessary comments**: comments explaining WHAT the code does, narrating the change, or referencing the task/caller — delete; keep only non-obvious WHY (hidden constraints, subtle invariants, workarounds)

#### Agent 3: Efficiency Review

Review the same changes for efficiency:

1. **Unnecessary work**: redundant computations, repeated file reads, duplicate network/API calls, N+1 patterns
2. **Missed concurrency**: independent operations run sequentially when they could run in parallel
3. **Hot-path bloat**: new blocking work added to startup or per-request/per-render hot paths
4. **Recurring no-op updates**: state/store updates inside polling loops or event handlers that fire unconditionally — add a change-detection guard
5. **Unnecessary existence checks**: pre-checking file/resource existence before operating (TOCTOU anti-pattern) — operate directly and handle the error
6. **Memory**: unbounded data structures, missing cleanup, event listener leaks
7. **Overly broad operations**: reading entire files when only a portion is needed, loading all items when filtering for one

## Phase 3: Fix Issues

Wait for all agents to complete (full mode) or finish the inline scan (fast mode). Aggregate findings and fix each issue directly. If a finding is a false positive or not worth addressing, note it and move on.

Briefly summarize what was fixed (or confirm the code was already clean).

---

## Phase 4: Stamp (mandatory final step)

After summarizing findings, run the stamp command matching the mode used:

```bash
# fast mode:
RAGENT_SKILL_INVOCATION_TOKEN=1 bash .claude/hooks/stamp_pre_commit_approved.sh simplify:fast

# full mode (or no --mode argument):
RAGENT_SKILL_INVOCATION_TOKEN=1 bash .claude/hooks/stamp_pre_commit_approved.sh simplify:full
```
